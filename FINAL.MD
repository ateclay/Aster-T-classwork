# FINAL PART II
Project  Concept:
Despite the rising housing costs and the existence of multiple other homeownership programs within Pittsburgh, the HACP’s Homeownership program continues successfully  service low to moderate income buyers. This is due to HACP’s unique 2nd soft mortgage program which provides up to 52,000 as a 2nd mortgage forgivable after 10 years. The program also provides closing cost assistance and request participant to complete buy education and credit counseling. The financial incentive and educational components for the program have allowed the Homeownership program to thrive and run more smoothly than similarly structured organizations.

During the feedback sessions I was able to find solutions to a few design issues I confirmed what items I should emphasis and how to better convey my story to the primary stakeholder. A consistent point throughout  all three interviews was the need for better labels and consistent titles and subheading. Also there was a lack of clarity concerning the audience. It was unclear who the presentation was intend for. Until the call for action the story seems unfocused. 
Another main point was the need for context. I could make a stronger call to action if I could provide compassion data from past years. I could even focus on one data point or trend to show the drastic increase in home purchases in 2018.[Feedback Script link](https://ateclay.github.io/Aster-T-classwork/SCRIPT.pdf)

# Final Data Story 

The purpose of the homeownership program is to support low-income families and Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher holders in the home buying process. In order to support its population, the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP) has partnered with other organizations in order to provide educational and financially supportive components to the program. In order to provide this essential resources there must be adequate funding to maintain program cost as the program expands and more families seek support in attaining homeownership.

# The Audience:

The main audience are the decision makers. The HACP Executive Director and the Board of Commissioners. They approve the annual operating budget and allocation of funds. Currently only $500,000 is allocated annualy to the Homeownership program. In 2018 total program costs were over $400,000 and would have exceeded the budgeted amount if delays in real estate transactions toward the end of the year hadn't occurred. It’s clear the program is growing and in addition to capital for housing assistance there will need to be long term investment in the program. The Board of Commissioners has a high level view of the program and providing them with the data expressing the rapid increase in total market cost and relating it to the demographic profile of eligible participants will help to humanize the numbers

# The Design:

I wanted to make the data as clear as possible. Almost all of the information presented in HACP reports and Board meetings are publicly accessible. Also the Board and the ED must be able to stand firmly behind any financial or programmatic decision made on behalf of the authority. I focused on the rising housing costs and the profile of “who qualifies”. There is a misconception about the affordable housing and public resources. Many believe it's for people who don’t want to work or want to rely on the system. In actuality, many Pittsburgh households would qualify and are the intended recipients of the Homeownership program. I focused on several main data points such as income, home cost, program costs and affordability to move the story toward the call to action but also explain a complex housing issue in a digestible format.
