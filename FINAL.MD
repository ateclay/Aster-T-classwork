# FINAL PART II
Project  Concept:
Despite the rising housing costs and the existence of multiple other homeownership programs within Pittsburgh, the HACP’s Homeownership program continues successfully  service low to moderate income buyers. This is due to HACP’s unique 2nd soft mortgage program which provides up to 52,000 as a 2nd mortgage forgivable after 10 years. The program also provides closing cost assistance and request participant to complete buy education and credit counseling. The financial incentive and educational components for the program have allowed the Homeownership program to thrive and run more smoothly than similarly structured organizations.
