# FINAL PART II
Project  Concept:
Despite the rising housing costs and the existence of multiple other homeownership programs within Pittsburgh, the HACP’s Homeownership program continues successfully  service low to moderate income buyers. This is due to HACP’s unique 2nd soft mortgage program which provides up to 52,000 as a 2nd mortgage forgivable after 10 years. The program also provides closing cost assistance and request participant to complete buy education and credit counseling. The financial incentive and educational components for the program have allowed the Homeownership program to thrive and run more smoothly than similarly structured organizations.

During the feedback sessions I was able to find solutions to a few design issues I confirmed what items I should emphasis and how to better convey my story to the primary stakeholder. A consistent point throughout  all three interviews was the need for better labels and consistent titles and subheading. Also there was a lack of clarity concerning the audience. It was unclear who the presentation was intend for. Until the call for action the story seems unfocused. 
Another main point was the need for context. I could make a stronger call to action if I could provide compassion data from past years. I could even focus on one data point or trend to show the drastic increase in home purchases in 2018.[Feedback Script link](https://ateclay.github.io/Aster-T-classwork/SCRIPT.pdf)
